# List Project Goals
- Find useable repo's 
- Fork them to your github acct 
- Run example code

# Describe Your Findings
- I found two repo's: 
  - One being a scrapper that used the black-scholes model to help calculate all call options within the S&P 500.
  - Two being a basic calculator that computed the fair value price of either a call or put option within European Contracts. 

# Game Plan
- Play around with code found on github.----------------------------------------- INCOMPLETE
- Make sure the file works properly.--------------------------------------------- INCOMPLETE
- Gain an understanding of what the repository code is doing.-------------------- INCOMPLETE 
- Make sure scrapper is active.-------------------------------------------------- INCOMPLETE
- Limit the amount of data being scrapped for demo purposes.--------------------- INCOMPLETE
- Use another set of code to use as a calculor.---------------------------------- INCOMPLETE
- Re-Formate software to match that of scrapper.--------------------------------- INCOMPLETE
- Test to see if software runs properly.----------------------------------------- INCOMPLETE
